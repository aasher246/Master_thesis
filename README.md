This research endeavors to develop a holistic health evaluation system by integrating deep learning models for various vital signs, including electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure, respiratory rate, and other relevant metrics. The study involves the creation of individual
models for each vital sign, followed by the synthesis of these models into a unified framework for comprehensive health status evaluation.

While individual vital sign monitoring provides valuable insights into specific aspects of health, a comprehensive evaluation demands an integrated approach. This research aims to leverage deep learning, primarily using TensorFlow and Keras, to create specialized models for different vital signs and, subsequently, fuse these models to deliver a unified health assessment.
